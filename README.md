[Build123d](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/direct_api_reference.html) is an open-source, BREP-based CAD system built on top of python. 

This repo contains the code for generating the 3d models that we print and used in the Test&Experience Center.
The final stl are also available on [printable](https://www.printables.com/fr/@FARIBrussels_1498596).
